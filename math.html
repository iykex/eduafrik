        <h2>Math in Everyday Life</h2>
        <p>Math is everywhere! We use it for shopping, building, and even in art. From the markets of Accra to the pyramids of Egypt, math has helped shape our world.</p>

        <h2>Counting with Ghanaian Currency</h2>
        <p>In Ghana, the currency is the Cedi (GH₵). Let's practice counting with it:</p>
        <p>If one loaf of bread costs GH₵ 5, and you buy two loaves, how much do you pay? <br>GH₵ 5 + GH₵ 5 = GH₵ 10.</p>
        <p>If you have GH₵ 20 and you spend GH₵ 12 on rice, how much do you have left? <br>GH₵ 20 - GH₵ 12 = GH₵ 8.</p>

        <h2>Patterns in African Art</h2>
        <p>Many traditional African fabrics, like Kente cloth from Ghana, are filled with beautiful geometric patterns. These patterns are a form of math, using shapes like squares, triangles, and rectangles to create amazing designs. Look for patterns in the world around you!</p>

        <h2>World Measurements</h2>
        <p>Math helps us measure our world. The tallest mountain in Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro, is about 5,895 meters high. The longest river in the world, the Nile, flows for about 6,650 kilometers through northeastern Africa.</p>

        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
        <p>Math helps us solve problems. If a farmer in Ghana has 5 goats, and each goat has 4 legs, how many legs are there in total? <br>5 goats x 4 legs/goat = 20 legs.</p>
