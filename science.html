        <h2>The Natural World</h2>
        <p>Science helps us understand the world, from the smallest insects to the largest stars. Africa is home to an amazing variety of plants, animals, and ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>Ghana's Rainforest</h2>
        <p>The rainforests of Ghana, like Kakum National Park, are full of life. They are home to animals like forest elephants, monkeys, and many species of birds. The tall trees in the rainforest provide shade and shelter, creating a unique habitat. These forests are important for the whole world because they produce oxygen, which we all need to breathe.</p>

        <h2>The Great Rift Valley</h2>
        <p>Stretching over 6,000 kilometers from the Middle East to Mozambique, the Great Rift Valley is a massive geological feature in East Africa. It was formed by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates and is home to many volcanoes, lakes, and diverse wildlife. It is also where some of the oldest human fossils have been discovered, making it the "cradle of humankind."</p>

        <h2>Water is Life</h2>
        <p>Water is essential for all living things. The Volta River in Ghana is a vital source of water for drinking, farming, and generating electricity. Around the world, oceans, rivers, and lakes support countless species and regulate the Earth's climate. It is important to keep our water sources clean.</p>

        <h2>The Food Chain</h2>
        <p>In nature, energy flows from one living thing to another. This is called a food chain. For example, grass is eaten by a zebra, and the zebra might be eaten by a lion. This shows how plants and animals depend on each other to survive.</p>
