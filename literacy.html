        <h2>The Power of Words</h2>
        <p>Literacy is the ability to read and write. It is a skill that connects us to the world, allowing us to share stories, learn new things, and communicate with others across Africa and the globe.</p>

        <h2>Story Time: Ananse the Spider</h2>
        <p>In Ghana and across West Africa, stories of Ananse the Spider are very popular. Ananse is a trickster who is known for his wisdom and cunning. One famous story tells of how Ananse gathered all the wisdom of the world in a pot, intending to keep it for himself. But as he tried to hide the pot in a tall tree, it fell and broke, scattering wisdom all over the world for everyone to share.</p>
        
        <h2>Reading Practice: A Proverb from Africa</h2>
        <p>Read the proverb below and think about its meaning:</p>
        <p><em>"A single bracelet does not jingle."</em></p>
        <p>This proverb, found in many African cultures, teaches us about the importance of teamwork and community. Just as one bracelet makes no sound, a single person cannot achieve much alone.</p>

        <h2>Global Communication</h2>
        <p>Being able to read and write allows you to connect with people from all over the world. You can read books from different countries, write letters to friends far away, and learn about different cultures online.</p>

        <h2>Writing for Different Purposes</h2>
        <p>Writing can take many forms. A <strong>story</strong> tells about events and characters. A <strong>poem</strong> uses creative language to express feelings. A <strong>letter</strong> is a message written to someone else. Each style has its own purpose and structure.</p>
